This README describes the code and data provided to accompany
"Introduction to Machine Learning" (ML-teachco-9070), taught by Michael 
Littman for The Great Courses.

ForÂ more information getting started, please see the accompanying file:

- Introduction to Machine Learning L02.pdf: This pdf is the section
  from the course guidebook that details how to get started with Python
  notebooks and Colab. For access to the rest of the guidebook, sign up
  for the course itself at TheGreatCourses.com!

The program files provided here consist of three types:

- FOLLOW ALONG during or after lessons using the program files with
  simple names like L01.ipynb, L02.ipynb, and so on. They are in the
  .ipynb format discussed in Lesson 02 and are included for each of the
  specific lessons, from 02 to 25.
  
- AUXILIARY ("aux") files are provided for background information for
  those curious to explore other elements that appear on screen during
  lessons. Files with names like L01aux.ipynb, L03aux.ipynb, and so on
  are used by the instructor in the lesson, but that are not discussed
  explicitly. Not every lesson has one of these "auxillary" files. Note:
  Even users making diligent use of the FOLLOW ALONG and QUESTIONS
  program files can skip the AUXILIARY files. 

- QUESTIONS ("qs") FOR MORE PRACTICE are program files with names like
  L01qs.ipynb, L02qs.ipynb, and so on. They are associated with the
  practice problems for each lesson (which appear in the guidebook 
  for each lesson as question number 3).
  
Direct links to all program files are provided through the course
guidebook and through The Great Courses website. You can also access
them directly using a link like:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/mlittmancs/great_courses_ml/blob/master/L02.ipynb .

This particular link is the program associated with the "Starting with
Python Notebooks and Colab" lesson, Lesson 02. To access any other file,
simply take out the L02 in the above link and put in L16qs, or whatever
the name of the file is that you want to work with next.
************************************************************************

This file repository also includes three other sets of files necessary
to run the program files:

- imgs: A directory of images used by the program files.

- data: A directory of local datasets used by the program files.

- requirements.txt: A file required by colab that lists library
  dependencies.
  
- README: This file.
